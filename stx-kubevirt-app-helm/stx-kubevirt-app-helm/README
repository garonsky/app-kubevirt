This directory contains all StarlingX charts that need to be built for this
application. The Helm Charts are derived from Kubernetes yaml files for KubeVirt.
The original sources were retrieved from:

https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/${VERSION}/kubevirt-cr.yaml
https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/${VERSION}/kubevirt-operator.yaml.

Additional information can be found at https://kubevirt.io/.

As the KubeVirt versions are updated, maintainers of this repo will need to update
the helm charts.
